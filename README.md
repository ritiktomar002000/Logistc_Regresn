# 🐶 Dog vs Non-Dog Image Classification using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a binary image classification system to distinguish between dog and non-dog images using Logistic Regression built from scratch in NumPy.

The goal of this project was to understand the mathematical foundations of machine learning by implementing gradient descent optimization, forward propagation, and backpropagation manually without using high-level ML libraries.
